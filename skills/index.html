                        <p> I learned from working in healthcare that every situation requires it's own unique solution. 
                            Every patient, client, or customer is different. I feel it is important to be able to 
                            adjust to the needs of each client for a more successful outcome. It is also important to be
                            flexible in a team enviornment.  </p>
